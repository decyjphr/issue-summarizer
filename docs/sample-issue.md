## Current Behavior

When running the application, the login process fails with a 401 Unauthorized error even though the correct credentials are provided.

## Expected Behavior

The login process should authenticate the user successfully and redirect to the dashboard.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Click the "Sign In" button
4. Observe the error in the console

## Environment

- Browser: Chrome 96.0.4664.110
- OS: Windows 10
- Backend API: v2.3.1

## Possible Solution

The authentication token might not be properly sent in the request headers. We should check the Authorization header format.

## Tasks

- [ ] Investigate the network requests during login
- [ ] Verify token format in the request headers
- [ ] Check server logs for any additional error details
- [ ] Fix the authentication flow
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling
